# Graphmation Forge
If you're looking here to see my coding ability, then maybe look somewhere else.. This was to learn Win32 and my first attempt at a windows application that isn't a game.

This was mainly a way for me to learn about how programming with Win32 goes. There's a lot of things I'd do differently, and maybe someday I'll return and make a proper node editor.

Graphmation Forge is a visual node-based animation graph editor.

Create animation states and transitions between them!

Export to JSON! Wow!

Link to arbitrary animation names!

Very cool!

This is a tool that I'm creating for a personal project that needs animation states
